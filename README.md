INTRODUCTION
------------
    Energy DB is an interactive map and visualization tool for oil wells in and around Houston. Such information is publicly available ([rrc.state.tx.us][1]) but difficult to locate and time-consuming to compile and/or search. The purpose of this application is to make the data easier to parse and visualize in an appealing way.

    Built entirely on the client-side in ReactJS with Uber's Vis.gl suite, D3, and redux.
